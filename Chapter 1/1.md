# Enter the following expressions into ghci. What are their types?

- 5 + 8 
- 3 * 5 + 8 
- 2 + 4 
- (+) 2 4 
- sqrt 16 
- succ 6 
- succ 7 
- pred 9 
- pred 8 
- sin (pi / 2) 
- truncate pi 
- round 3.5 
- round 3.4 
- floor 3.7 
- ceiling 3.3

## solving

Using the command 
```
:set +t
```

The result is 

```
Prelude> :set +t
Prelude> 5 + 8
13
it :: Num a => a
Prelude> 13

it :: Num p => p
Prelude> 5 + 8

# From ghci, type :? to print some help. Define a variable, such as let x = 1, and then type :show bindings. What do you see?

## solving

Command **:?** is the help of ghci command.

```
Prelude> let x = 1
Prelude> :show bindings
x :: Num p => p = _
Prelude> let y = 1.0
Prelude> :show bindings
x :: Num p => p = _
y :: Fractional p => p = _
```

Q2 show us the type of the variable and something we dont know about .

using the **:?** to get helps

> show the current bindings made at the prompt

# The words function counts the number of words in a string. Modify the WC.hs example in order to count the number of words in a file.

## solving

The sample is

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (lines input)) ++ "\n"

```

guess the function lines is counting the line of the text, so replacing the lines with words

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (words input)) ++ "\n"

```

------

# Modify the WC.hs example again, in order to print the number of characters in a file.

## solving

The sample is

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (lines input)) ++ "\n"

```

Try the fuction chars and characters, but it doesn't work. Finally, it does not need any function at all ......

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length input) ++ "\n"

```
