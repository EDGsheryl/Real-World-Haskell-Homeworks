# The words function counts the number of words in a string. Modify the WC.hs example in order to count the number of words in a file.

------

## solving

The sample is

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (lines input)) ++ "\n"

```

guess the function lines is counting the line of the text, so replacing the lines with words

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (words input)) ++ "\n"

```
