# Modify the WC.hs example again, in order to print the number of characters in a file.

## solving

The sample is

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length (lines input)) ++ "\n"

```

Try the fuction chars and characters, but it doesn't work. Finally, it does not need any function at all ......

```Haskell
main = interact wordCount
    where wordCount input = show (length input) ++ "\n"

```
