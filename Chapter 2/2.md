# Haskell provides a standard function, last :: [a] -> a, that returns the last element of a list. From reading the type alone, what are the possible valid behaviors (omitting crashes and infinite loops) that this function could have? What are a few things that this function clearly cannot do?

## Solving

No parameter or invaild paramaters.

Some paramater caused infinite loops like [1..]

------

# Write a function, lastButOne, that returns the element before the last.

```Haskell
-- file: lastButOne.hs
lastButOne xs = 
    if null (tail (tail xs)) 
        then 
            head xs
        else 
            lastButOne (tail xs)

```
 
------

# Load your lastButOne function into ghci and try it out on lists of different lengths. What happens when you pass it a list thatâ€™s too short?

We will receive a Exception.

```
